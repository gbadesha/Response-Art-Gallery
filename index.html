                In her large-scale three-panel painting, Written in the Sky (2022), Pierre reimagines a historical altarpiece,
                populating it with beings from a universe she has invented. Transforming the traditional depiction of the Virgin Mary’s
                ascent into Heaven from something passive into something transcendent, Pierre’s female figure dominates the centre
                panel, supported on the heads of two other beings, as a star bursts behind her
